1. Never assume your input is clean
2. Never assume your code is doing what you think it's doing
3. Never assume you will come back to this code
4. Never assume that the user will be limited to the logical and sensible
5. On second thought, never assume anything


Addendum: If you are reviewing my code, then you are my last line of defense against mistakes. If you are trying to be nice with my PR, then I cannot trust you to be that defense.
